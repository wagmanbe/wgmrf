### Calculate GMRF cost

Instructions: 
```
git clone https://bmw939@bitbucket.org/bmw939/gmrf_demo.git
cd gmrf_demo
Rscript gmrf-cost-11f-4s-3r.R
```
OR using Rstudio "source" gmrf-cost-11f-4s-3r.R 

Warning. Running this example takes about 30-40 min on my laptop.

After successful completion, a `results` directory with two subdirectories and cost output with .Rdata, .txt, and .dat suffixes  

You might need to install packages for the R libraries. This is easy to do in R.

Here's what's included:

`gmrf-cost-11f-4s-3r.R`

  + main R script for calculating GMRF cost 
  + named because it operates on 11 fields, 4 seasons, 3 regions
  + computes traditional, fields, and field-and-space cost

 **Rcode (dir)**

  + `process_obs.R` 
  + `docosts.R`  

 **external_weights (dir)**

  + `Q.Rdata` GMRF operators. These apply only to this example grid and its regional partitioning. For any other grid or regional partitioning, you need to make your own. See:  
`Nosedal-Sanchez, A., C. Jackson, and G. Huerta, 2016. A new test statistic for climate models that includes field and spatial dependencies using Gaussian Markov random fields. Geoscientific Model Development, 9(7):2407â€“2414.`  https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/9/2407/2016/
  + `S_and_q_coeffs.mat` Region-season-specific scaling factors (S_q) and global scaling factor (S_tot) computed outside of this code using results of perfect model experiments  
  +`alpha_solutions.Rdata` Optimal values for the GMRF spatial parameter alpha. Grid-dependent. See eqn. 5 in Nosedal Sanchez et al. 2016 referenced above. 


 **model_seasonal_climo (dir)**

  + climatologies of model output for DJF, MAM, JJA, SON on lat x lon (192 x 288) 
  +`balance.txt` Model annual-mean global-mean radiative imbalance at the TOA  

 **obs_monthly (dir)**

  + monthly observations for eight years for the same fields on lat x lon (192 x 288)
